Hello and welcome to Sergei's repo

### Key facts
- Never use Microsoft products; they with throw you over the shoulder in <sub>fancy<sub> <sup>ways<sup>;
- Estimate your running costs 7 times before considering going to public cloud; you'll be surprised that number of measurements matches the price difference with on-prem - cloud is 7x the price;
- If you have a choice, go open-source anywhere you can; there be <ins>dragons<ins> in compiled software;
- Never forget that `with great power comes great responsibility`; that's why never `sudo su`;
- In case something like 192.168.1.1 rather than 2cab:78b5::4cff is on top of your head when you hear somebody saying `what's your IP`, then I have ~~disasterous~~ ~~bad~~ news for you - it's not yet 1998 on the calendar and RFC 2460 is yet to be published;
- ***I've never been repeating myself***, thus please never ever use Microsoft products.
